Brogue Rebalanced (fan patch)

Open-source under the same license as Brogue (AGPL).

* Rebalance Brogue's items so that lesser-used items can get more play
* At this time, there are no plans to add or remove items - this is to ensure that Brogue seeds and BrogueR seeds have the same contents.
* Remove annoyances such as item destruction
* Reduce "spoilery" behavior such as certain rings identifying on equip, and other rings not doing so

Gambler_Justice, as one of the most experienced players in the Brogue community, has been heavily mined for balance advice.
